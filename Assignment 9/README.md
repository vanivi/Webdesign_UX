For this assignment, we had to connect the previous assignment and create a react app.

1. The login page will first check for the entered email and password. This page sends the post request to localhost:8000/user/login which is the route created in the assignment 8th repository. If the entered details match then it will redirect to the homepage of the website, if not then it will throw an error.

2. The website has 4 different pages, Home, Job, About, and Contact us page. Navbar is used in the website to navigate between different webpages.

3. The card component is used on each page to give a small detail of the page. Here three props are taken which are header, description and the isShowButton.

4. React map() is also used to make the button in the card component dynamic.

5. CSS and additional texts are used to make attractive UI.
