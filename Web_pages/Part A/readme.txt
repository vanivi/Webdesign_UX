I have created an online dress boutique taking the inspiration from the Tueta Matoshi fashion line.
The HTML controls which I used in the website are as follows:-

1) Title <title> is added to display the title of the document or the webpage in the browser. 
I have given 'Vivi Store' as the title of my webpages. 

2) <img> This was used to add the images in the website. 
It includes the logo image, product images, etc. It is used to specify the path of where the image is saved in the system and then we can link it into the webpage. 

3) <nav> For making the navigation bar or the navigation section, the <nav> tag was used. 
It can be used to link other webpages in the current page and to navigate to a different webpage.

4) <ul> and <li> These tags were used to create an unordered list in the navigation section. 
I createed different elements in the list using <li> such as Home, About, Categories and Contact Us.

5) <a> This was used to insert different links or specific URL for each of the webpage. 
The destination of the hyperlinks can be given using this control and when clicked, it will navigate to that link or the webpage. 
In the assignment, I used this control to add links for the Home and Contact Us webpages.

6) Button was used to create a clickable element in the webpage. 
We can add links or link a new webpage to this button. 

7) Favicon was added to the website using the <link rel> tag, it is basically the small image displayed in the browser tab next to the title of the website.

8) Headings, <h1> <h2> <h3> tags were used to insert the various headings in the webpages for categories, featured dresses, etc. 
The numbers for heading tag is ranked from 1 to 6, with 1 being the most important or the main heading and 6 being less important or the last in the hierarchy.

9) Paragraph <p> tag is used to add the text in a website.

10) Division <div> is used to create the containers or the different divisions for the content of the webpage. 
It is used to separate the text, images, header, etc in the webpages. 

11) Table is used to create a static page of the checkout section. 
I have added texts and images in the table to make the static cart or the checkout section of the website. 

12) Form, I have used this for creating the 'contact us' webpage where in the user can input his/her details and queries. 

13) Header and footer are also used in the webpages.
