I have created a Portolio website using HTML/CSS.
The controls which I used in this website are as follows:-

1) Title <title> is added to display the title of the document or the webpage in the browser. 
I have given 'Vidhi's Portfolio' as the title of my website.

2) <img> This was used to add the images in the website. 
It includes the logo image, product images, etc. It is used to specify the path of where the image is saved in the system and then we can link it into the webpage. 

3) <nav> For making the navigation bar or the navigation section, the <nav> tag was used. 
It can be used to link other webpages in the current page and to navigate to a different webpage.

4) <ul> and <li> These tags were used to create an unordered list in the navigation section. 
I created different elements in the list using <li> such as About, certificates, skills, etc.

5) <a> This was used to insert different links or specific URL for each of the webpage. 
The destination of the hyperlinks can be given using this control and when clicked, it will navigate to that link or the webpage.

6) Button was used to create a clickable element in the webpage. 
We can add links or link a new webpage to this button. 

7) Favicon was added to the website using the <link rel> tag, it is basically the small image displayed in the browser tab next to the title of the website.

8) Headings, <h1> <h2> <h3> tags were used to insert the various headings in the webpages.
The numbers for heading tag is ranked from 1 to 6, with 1 being the most important or the main heading and 6 being less important or the last in the hierarchy.

9) Paragraph <p> tag is used to add the text in a website.

10) Division <div> is used to create the containers or the different divisions for the content of the webpage. 
It is used to separate the text, images, header, etc in the webpages. 

11) Progress bar <progress> is created to display the skills that I possess in terms of the percentage bars.

12) <figure> tag is used to insert any content such as pictures, graphs, etc. 

13) Header and footer are also used in the webpages.
